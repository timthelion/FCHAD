There is an inconsistency between actual behavior and the arduino documentation.
http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/StringConstructor
http://arduino.cc/en/Serial/Print

According to the documentation, a String can be initialized using a constant
in the form of "some text here".  However this fails to add a null terminator to
the end of the String.  As such this code does not work:

String settings[]={
"CURSOR_DRIVER"
"BRLTTY_DRIVER"
"BUFFER_SIZE_MAX"
"BUFFER_COLUMNS"
"BUFFER_ROWS"
"DOTCOUNT"};

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println(settings[0]);
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly: 
  
}
While this code does.

String settings[]={
"CURSOR_DRIVER\0"
"BRLTTY_DRIVER\0"
"BUFFER_SIZE_MAX\0"
"BUFFER_COLUMNS\0"
"BUFFER_ROWS\0"
"DOTCOUNT\0"};

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println(settings[0]);
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly: 
  
}




I must note, that this is really only a problem in documentation.
The documentation for the print command clearly states that it works on any
data type:

http://arduino.cc/en/Serial/Print
val: the value to print - any data type

And yet in reality, it works on NULL terminated strings but not length bounded
Strings....
