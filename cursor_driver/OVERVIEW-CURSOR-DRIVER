Overview of the cursor driver for arduino based Fast Charicter Braille Display
(FCHAD)s.

Please read OVERVIEW-FCHAD first in the FCHAD_firmware directory first.
Then read OVERVIEW-BRLTTY-DRIVER in the FCHAD directory.
Finally continue on to this document.

IDENTIFY MODE
!!TODO, add check sums to identify mode!!

Cursor driver identifies itself to the FCHAD device by writting 
"CURSOR DRIVER - FCHAD?\n" to the serial.  The cursor driver then needs 
to wait several milliseconds while the FCHAD pauses communications with
the BRLTTY driver.

Then the FCHAD will respond with something like:

"""
FCHAD\n
CURSOR_DRIVER=driver name\n
BRLTTY_DRIVER=driver name\n
BUFFER_COLUMNS_MAX=###\n
BUFFER_ROWS_MAX=###\n
BUFFER_COLUMNS=###\n
BUFFER_ROWS=###\n
DOTCOUNT=###\n
END_HEADER\n
"""
The cursor driver will then write back:


"""
CURSOR DRIVER\n
CURSOR_DRIVER=driver name\n
BUFFER_COLUMNS=###\n
BUFFER_ROWS=###\n
END_HEADER\n
"""

Setting any settings that it wants to set and excluding the rest.

The cursor driver then enters into idle mode.

IDLE MODE

For the cursor driver, this means that the cursor driver should take events
from the cursor device, and turn them into messages to the FCHAD device.

These messages are in the form of:
First byte:
3    - The next four bytes will define an x, y cursor possition in the display 
buffer.
or
5    - The next two bytes will be a keycode to be sent to the brltty driver.s
